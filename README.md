# RestAPI_Mongoose_Node

This is just a test to see how we can build a REST API to make sure we can add some Disney Character..

# Start Pulling Data

```
GET http://localhost:3000/disneyCharacters
```

# Start Adding New Disney Characters

```
POST http://localhost:3000/localhost:3000/disneyCharacters

```

# Start Updating Disney Character

```

PATCH http://localhost:3000/localhost:3000/disneyCharacters/[character_id]

```

# Start Deleting Characters

```

DELETE http://localhost:3000/localhost:3000/disneyCharacters/[character_id]

```
